# Human Transcriptomic Clock

## Overview

The difference between a person’s biological age and chronological age can be predicted using an ageing clock. These ageing clocks are created using supervised machine learning methods, such as penalised regression techniques like elastic-net. Variations in RNA molecule abundance reflect various regulatory influences, resulting in significant changes in gene expression throughout an individual’s life. Identifying these changes is crucial for developing transcriptomic ageing biomarkers that are specific to RNA expression.

I developed a human transcriptomic clock using a quantilisation method and supervised machine learning techniques, including elastic-net regression and a simple neural network regression model, to predict biological age.
